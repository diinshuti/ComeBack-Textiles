	<p> Approximately 95% of all used clothing, footwear, and other household fabric products,
		such as sheets and towels, can be reused or recycled, yet only 15% of reusable textiles are recycled. Donate your gently-used clothes to a local organization to help populations in need and tackle
		climate change at the same time.</p>

	<h5> Be Part of the Change!!</h5>

	<h5> WHY DONATE?</h5>

	<p> You make a greater impact with your donated goods. Not only do you make a
		charitable donation, but you make a difference for the environment, by extending
		the life of unwanted items. Whether an item finds a second home from a thrift
		store shopper or is recycled and re-purposed for a different use, you are helping
		to keep it green!</p>
